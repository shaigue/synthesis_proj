# TODO: define the different grammars. grammars should define python expressions.
#  We might use special functions that it can use defined in python in a separate file
#  and for each grammar we should be able to compile it into a Z3 formula.
#  define interface with ASAF
#  safety properties should also be defined in this grammar so that they can be compiled in Z3 formulas
